                    This prompted me to add a buck converter to the module, which allowed the battery to be stepped down
                    to 5V at the price of increasing amperage; a very convenient trade-off when you have a maestro, a
                    camera, an R/C receiver, a fan, and a TPU accelerator all wired up to a single RaspberryPi

                    The Intel Movidius NCS2, when it released, was admittedly a mess; there was little to no useful
                    documentation on how to get it to work, and when you pair that with a retail price at $200, you can
                    see why these TPU's were discontinued (and why as of writing, you can get one for as low as $50 on
                    eBay)

                    That is actually the beauty of this module, as because my mentor Omar Ferrer and I managed to get it
                    to work, I now have an incredibly powerful and cheap platform that I can use to spearhead my future
                    in robotics (albeit with proprietary hardware)

                    With this module, I hope to re-immerse myself into the world of robotics, a place I have not been to
                    since the early 2010's as a child building Lego Technic with my brother

                    After its use in my robot dog Athena, who knows where this module will take me? Zeppelins?
                    Submarines? Smart cameras? Perhaps another, more capable robot dog? Who knows?

                    Whatever the case, I can count this module as another wonderful learning experience, and an
